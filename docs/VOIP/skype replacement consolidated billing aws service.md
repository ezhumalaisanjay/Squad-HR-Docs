# üìû Building a Skype Replacement on AWS with Consolidated Billing

## üß≠ Objective

Design a scalable, serverless architecture for a Skype-like application using AWS services, ensuring all costs are consolidated under a single AWS account, avoiding per-user billing models.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Frontend

- **Framework**: [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- **UI Library**: [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.dev/)
- **Deployment**: [AWS Amplify Gen 2](https://docs.amplify.aws/gen2/)

### Features

- **Modern UI**: Utilize Shadcn components for a sleek and accessible interface.
- **CI/CD**: Amplify Gen 2 provides continuous integration and deployment pipelines.
- **Hosting**: Deploy the React application using Amplify Hosting for global availability.

## üß† Backend

### API Layer

- **Option 1**: [AWS AppSync](https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/) (GraphQL)
- **Option 2**: [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) (REST) with [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)

### Compute

- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless functions to handle business logic, triggered by API requests.

### Data Storage

- **Amazon DynamoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user profiles, messages, and session data.

### Real-Time Communication

- **[Amazon Chime SDK](https://aws.amazon.com/chime/chime-sdk/)**: Enables voice, video, and messaging features.

  **Pricing**:
  - **WebRTC Media**: $0.0017 per attendee-minute.
  - **HD Video (720p)**: $0.01 per minute.
  - **Full HD Video (1080p)**: $0.0125 per minute.
  - **Active Speaker Video and Audio**: $0.0034 per minute.
  - **Audio Stream**: $0.0017 per minute.
  - **Individual Video/Content Share Streams**: $0.0017 per minute.
  - **Media Replication**: Additional charges based on usage.

  *Note: Charges apply for each attendee connected to a WebRTC media session, covering all media modalities (audio, video, screen share). Billing is in 6-second increments, with a 6-second minimum.*

## üîê Authentication & Authorization

### Option 1: **Amazon Cognito**

- **User Pools**: Manage user sign-up and sign-in.
- **Federated Identities**: Integrate with external identity providers (e.g., Google, Facebook).

  **Pricing**:
  - **Free Tier**: First 50,000 monthly active users (MAUs) are free.
  - **Beyond Free Tier**:
    - 50,001 ‚Äì 100,000 MAUs: $0.0055 per MAU.
    - 100,001 ‚Äì 1,000,000 MAUs: $0.0046 per MAU.
    - 1,000,001 ‚Äì 10,000,000 MAUs: $0.00325 per MAU.
    - Over 10,000,000 MAUs: $0.0025 per MAU.

  *Note: Advanced security features incur additional costs.*

### Option 2: **Custom Authentication**

- Implement custom authentication using AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway.
- Store user credentials securely in DynamoDB or AWS Secrets Manager.
- Utilize JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for session management.

*This approach can provide more control over authentication flows and potentially reduce costs associated with per-user billing.*

## üì¶ Deployment & CI/CD

- **AWS Amplify Gen 2**:
  - Automates the deployment process for both frontend and backend components.
  - Provides a unified workflow for building, testing, and deploying applications.
  - Consolidates billing for all integrated services under a single AWS account.

---

## üí∞ Cost Management

- **Consolidated Billing**: All AWS services used are billed under a single account, simplifying cost tracking and management.
- **Usage-Based Pricing**: Services like Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and Chime SDK charge based on usage metrics (e.g., compute time, API calls, data storage), not per user.
- **Monitoring Tools**:
  - **AWS Cost Explorer**: Analyze and visualize cost and usage patterns.
  - **AWS Budgets**: Set custom cost and usage budgets and receive alerts when thresholds are exceeded.

---

## ‚úÖ Advantages of This Architecture

- **Scalability**: Serverless components automatically scale with user demand.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay only for what you use, with no upfront costs or per-user fees.
- **Rapid Development**: Leverage modern frameworks and AWS services to accelerate development cycles.
- **Global Availability**: AWS services provide low-latency access to users worldwide.

## üìå Summary

By leveraging AWS's serverless offerings and modern frontend technologies, you can build a scalable and cost-effective Skype replacement. This architecture ensures all costs are consolidated under a single AWS account, with pricing based on actual usage rather than per-user fees.
