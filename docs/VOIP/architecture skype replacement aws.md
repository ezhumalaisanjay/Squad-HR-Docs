**Architectural Guide and Implementation Plan** for building a **Skype Replacement using AWS Services** under a single account with international calling support.

---

# üìò **Project Goal**
To develop a scalable, secure, and cost-efficient Skype-like application using AWS services, designed for both **messaging** and **international voice/video calls** ‚Äî specifically targeting users in **Panama, Singapore, and Switzerland** ‚Äî while consolidating costs under a single AWS account and avoiding per-user billing.

---

## üèóÔ∏è **Recommended Architecture Overview**

### üí° **Frontend**
- **Framework:** Next.js (React-based SSR/SSG)
- **Hosting & Deployment:** AWS Amplify Hosting (CI/CD, custom domains, SSL)
- **Authentication:** AWS Cognito (user pools, federated identities)

---

### üí° **Backend**
- **Serverless Application Framework:** AWS Amplify Gen 2 (build, test, deploy environments)
- **API Layer:** AWS AppSync (GraphQL APIs)
- **Database:** Amazon DynamoDB (NoSQL, scalable, low-latency)
- **Authentication & Authorization:** AWS Cognito
- **Media Streaming:** Amazon Chime SDK (for voice and video calling)
- **Messaging:** Amazon Chime SDK + WebSockets via AppSync
- **Storage:** Amazon S3 (chat media, attachments)
- **Notifications:** Amazon SNS + Amazon Pinpoint (for SMS/email push)
- **Infrastructure as Code:** AWS CloudFormation (Amplify handles this)

---

## ‚òéÔ∏è **International Calling Setup**

AWS **Chime SDK Voice Connector** will be used for **SIP-based international calling**:
- Supports outbound international calls.
- Compatible with Panama, Singapore, Switzerland, and global telephony.
- Pay-as-you-go pricing based on call minutes, not per-user.
- No physical SIP infrastructure required.

## üíº **Implementation Steps**

### Step 1: **Account and Domain Setup**
- Register a domain via Route 53.
- Set up your AWS Organizations account if you plan to scale horizontally.
- Enable CloudTrail and AWS Config for monitoring.

---

### Step 2: **Frontend Development**
1Ô∏è‚É£ Build your **Next.js** UI.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Connect frontend to Cognito for authentication.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Use Amplify Gen 2‚Äôs `amplify pull` & `amplify push` for CI/CD.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy via Amplify Hosting with SSL and subdomain routing.

---

### Step 3: **User Management**
- Configure **Cognito User Pools** for user signup, MFA, password policies.
- Use **Cognito Identity Pools** for temporary AWS credentials.
- Integrate **social logins** if needed (Google, Facebook, Apple).

---

### Step 4: **Messaging Backend**
- Create **AppSync GraphQL APIs** for:
    - Sending and receiving messages.
    - Contact lists and presence detection.
- Use DynamoDB for chat history.
- Use DynamoDB Streams and Lambda for real-time updates (if needed beyond AppSync Subscriptions).

---

### Step 5: **Voice & Video Calling**
- Integrate **Amazon Chime SDK** for:
    - WebRTC-based audio and video conferencing.
    - Meeting session management.
    - Participant control and signaling.
- Use **Amazon Chime Voice Connector** for:
    - Outbound calling to Panama, Singapore, Switzerland.
    - PSTN call bridging.
    - Billing is based on usage, not users.

---

### Step 6: **Media & File Sharing**
- Store attachments in **Amazon S3**.
- Use **pre-signed URLs** for secure file uploads/downloads.

---

### Step 7: **Notifications**
- Use **Amazon SNS** for SMS and system alerts.
- Use **Amazon Pinpoint** for targeted messaging and delivery analytics.

---

### Step 8: **Monitoring & Logging**
- Integrate **Amazon CloudWatch Logs** for Lambda, Chime, AppSync.
- Use **CloudWatch Metrics and Dashboards** for real-time health checks.
- Set alarms for error rates and billing thresholds.

---

### Step 9: **Security**
- Use **IAM roles and policies** to limit access.
- Implement **KMS encryption** for data at rest.
- Use **TLS 1.2+** for data in transit.

---

### Step 10: **Cost Optimization**
- Use **AWS Savings Plans** for Lambda, AppSync.
- Monitor Chime usage for international calls.
- Consolidate **all costs under one account** for simplified billing.
- Use **AWS Budgets** to prevent unexpected overages.

---

## üìå **Summary**
This architecture will allow you to:
- Replace Skype for chat and international calls.
- Use a **pay-for-usage model** (not per-user licensing).
- Scale globally using AWS‚Äôs infrastructure.
- Consolidate all costs into a single AWS billing account.

If you'd like, I can also create:
1. A **sample Amplify Gen 2 project structure**.
2. Example **GraphQL schema for chat and call management**.
3. A basic **Chime SDK JavaScript integration sample**.
