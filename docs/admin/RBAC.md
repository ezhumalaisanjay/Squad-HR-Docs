# 🏢 Multi-Tenant Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

## 🔍 Overview

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a security model that restricts access based on user roles within a system. In a **multi-tenant** architecture, each tenant has a hierarchical structure defining organizations, departments, squads (channels), and users with specific roles and permissions.
