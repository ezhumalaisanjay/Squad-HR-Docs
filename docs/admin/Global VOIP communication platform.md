## 4. System Architecture Overview

The solution follows a multi-tier, serverless, and multi-tenant architecture:

**Front End:**  
Developed using React and Shadcn UI components. Hosted and deployed via AWS Amplify Gen 2 for CI/CD integration and consolidated billing.

**Back End:**  
Comprises AWS API Gateway, AWS Lambda functions, and DynamoDB to handle API calls, process real-time events, and manage data (such as call records and user profiles).

**Telephony Integration:**  
Uses AWS Chime SDK for VOIP communication over WebRTC. For global PSTN connectivity and number provisioning, AWS Chime Voice Connector (or a third-party equivalent like Twilio/Plivo) is used to bridge traditional telephony with the AWS ecosystem.

**Authentication:**  
Either leveraging AWS Cognito (with careful monitoring of user-based costing) or a custom-built solution that minimizes cost and fits within the consolidated billing model.

---

### 5.2. Back-End and API Layer

**API Gateway & Lambda:**

- API Gateway: Exposes RESTful (or GraphQL via AppSync) endpoints used by the front end for signaling and user management.
- Lambda Functions: Handle business logic such as user session management, routing incoming calls, and processing call events.
- Serverless Deployment: Simplifies scaling and management, with costs based on request volume and execution time rather than a per-user fee.

---

### 5.3. Data Storage

**Amazon DynamoDB:**

- Used for persisting user profiles, session data, call logs, and registration information.
- Provides high performance and scalability with cost-efficient on-demand capacity.

---

### 5.4. Telephony Integration

**AWS Chime Voice Connector / Third-Party SIP Trunking:**

- **Provisioning:** Handles the acquisition of local phone numbers in Panama, Singapore, and Switzerland.
- **PSTN Bridging:** Routes incoming PSTN calls through a SIP trunk to your application backend.
- **Integration:** Works with AWS Lambda functions to authenticate the call, map the call to the appropriate VOIP client, and initiate a WebRTC session using the AWS Chime SDK.

**AWS Chime SDK:**

- Provides the tools to build the VOIP client supporting real-time audio sessions.
- Integrated with front-end components to manage call initiation, in-call signaling, and termination.

## 6. Call Flow and Interaction

**Incoming PSTN Call Reception:**

- A user’s assigned virtual phone number (provisioned via the telephony provider) receives an inbound call.

**Call Routing:**

- The call is passed from the PSTN through the AWS Chime Voice Connector (or third-party equivalent) to the backend.

**User Identification and Signaling:**

- AWS Lambda functions map the incoming call to the correct user based on stored registration data in DynamoDB.
- A push notification or WebSocket signal is sent to the user’s device to alert them of an incoming call.

**WebRTC Session Establishment:**

- The AWS Chime SDK facilitates the initiation of a WebRTC connection between the caller and the recipient.

**Call Handling:**

- The VOIP client, built in React, manages call acceptance, ongoing audio streaming, and termination.
