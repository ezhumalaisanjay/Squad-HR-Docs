# 📈 AI-Powered Automated Nifty Options Trading – System Overview

## 🔁 Daily Setup: Generate Access Token
- **Upstox API access tokens are short-lived**.
- You must **generate a new access token daily** using the authorization code.
- This token is used to authenticate all trading and data API calls.

## 🧠 Trading Concepts

### 🔵 Long Position (Buy)
- You buy an asset expecting the **price to rise**.
- You **own the asset**.
- Profit if: **Sell Price > Buy Price**.

### 🔴 Short Position (Sell First)
- You **borrow and sell** an asset expecting the **price to fall**.
- You **buy back later** at a lower price.
- Used in **intraday only**.
- Profit if: **Buyback Price < Initial Sell Price**.

---

## 📉 Stop Loss (SL)
- A predefined price where the position is exited to **limit loss**.
- Example: Buy at ₹100, SL at ₹95.
- In Upstox, **SL can be set or modified via `modify_order` API**.
- **Managed at exchange level**, so it's automatically executed.

---

## 📈 Take Profit (TP)
- A target price to **exit the trade with profit**.
- Example: Buy at ₹100, TP at ₹110.
- **Not directly supported** by Upstox API.
- You must:
  - Store TP in your **own database**.
  - **Monitor market price via WebSocket**.
  - **Sell manually via API** when TP is reached.

---

## 🔌 WebSocket Feed
- Used to receive **live market price updates**.
- Supports per-second, lossless ticks for instruments (e.g., Nifty options).
- Used to:
  - Monitor SL/TP targets
  - Drive exit logic

---

## 🛠️ Order Lifecycle Workflow

1. **Place Entry Order** (Buy or Short Sell)
2. **Set Stop Loss (SL)** using `modify_order` API
3. **Save Take Profit (TP)** in database
4. **Subscribe to live price** via WebSocket
5. **Monitor price in real-time**:
   - If price hits SL → Order auto-exits (exchange handled)
   - If price hits TP → App places manual sell order via API
6. **Exit All Positions** logic can be used at day-end if needed
